# Personal Trainer Tracker

Welcome to the Personal Trainer Tracker. This application was created with the idea of giving personal trainers the ability to create their client's file with pieces of information from name and age to waist and hip ratio which they can use the built-in calculator to check what category their clients are in.

Anyone that goes on the website can check their waist to hip ratio on the Welcome page, where the calculator is, and check on the table for the result. Knowing the result they're also able to see all the trainers (who are signed up) and email them to be a potential client.
