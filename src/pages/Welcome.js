        According to the World Health Organization (WHO), having a WHR of over 1.0 may increase the risk of developing conditions that relate to being overweight, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes.

This may be the case even if other measures of being overweight, such as body mass index (BMI) are in normal range.

The WHO advise that a healthy WHR is:

0.85 or less for women
0.9 or less for men
The following chart shows how the WHO classify the risk of being affected by weight related health conditions according to WHR:
